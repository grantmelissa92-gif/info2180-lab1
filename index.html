        <h2>Melissa Grant</h2>
        <p>My name is Melissa. I'm currently studying Computer Science and have an interest in data. After I graduate 
            I may pursue a career as a data engineer. My favourite color is navy blue, though I'm also fascinated by 
            interesting color combinations especially in clothing. In my spare I like to read, I'm currently reading a 
            series called 'An Ember in the Ashes' by Sabaa Tahir. It's a dry read, but I'm determined to finish it. If 
            you're a fanasty reader, I'm not sure if I would recommend it. I also like to watch sports, particularly 
            volleyball, ice hockey and basketball. I also like to play video games, at the moment I'm really enjoying 
            Disney SpeedStorm. I am interested in Web Development because over the summer I was asked if i could create a website and was unable to create something proper and of high standards, this course can 		act as a stepping stone so that if in the future I'm asked to build a website I would have some understanding. </p>
